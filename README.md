## Overview

The Huffman Coding Virtual Lab is an interactive web application built with Django that allows users to learn about Huffman coding, a popular algorithm for lossless data compression. The application provides theoretical foundations, step-by-step procedures, pre-test and post-test evaluations, and interactive simulations to help users understand and apply Huffman coding concepts.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Learning Path**: Structured learning sequence from theory to practical application
- **Interactive Simulations**: Step-by-step simulation of the Huffman coding algorithm
- **Pre and Post Testing**: Knowledge assessment before and after the simulation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various devices and screen sizes
- **Certificate Generation**: Create certificates upon successful completion of the lab

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `huffman_lab/`: Contains the main Django application code
- `static/`: Holds static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the web application
- `tests/`: Includes unit tests for the application
- `docs/`: Documentation and resources for the project

## Requirements

To run the Huffman Coding Virtual Lab, you need the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 3.2 or higher
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- SQLite (default database for Django)

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/huffman-coding-lab.git
   cd huffman-coding-lab
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the application.

## Deployment

To deploy the project, follow these steps:

1. Set up a production server (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean).
2. Configure the database and environment variables.
3. Use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve the application.
4. Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache.
5. Ensure static files are collected using:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

## Usage Guide

1. Navigate to the homepage to start learning about Huffman coding.
2. Follow the theoretical content and interactive simulations.
3. Complete the pre-test and post-test evaluations.
4. Generate a certificate upon successful completion.
